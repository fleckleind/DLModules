# BNN

BNN: a type of neural network that activations/features and weights are 1-bit values in all the hidden layer, except the input and output layers. With binarization, compacting 32-bit to 1-bit values, BNN save the expensive model's storage and reduce the matrix computation costs by using XNOR and popcount operations.
