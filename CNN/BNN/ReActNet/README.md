# ReActNet
[ReActNet: Towards Precise Binary Neural Network with Generalized Activation Functions](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2003.03488)

ReActNet: generalize traditional Sign and PReLU functions as RSign and RPReLU for explicit learning of activation distribution, and adopt a distribution loss for similarity between binary and real-valued network.
